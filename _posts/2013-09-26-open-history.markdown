<p>I am seriously considering the possibility to follow W. Caleb McDaniel's (<a href="https://twitter.com/wcaleb" target="_blank">@wcaleb</a>) <a href="http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu/" target="_blank">steps</a> and set up a wiki or some other system (Github, maybe?) where to make my research process and notes open source (in part they are already, if you look at my <a href="https://www.zotero.org/wilko.hardenberg/items" target="_blank">Zotero library</a>). Caleb has some very convincing motives to do this, and his <a href="http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> on this is definitely the place to look at if you need to be convinced.</p>
<p>This will be part of a general overhaul of the whole site, which I hope to be able to undertake some time before the beginning of next semester. I'll try to keep you posted.</p>
