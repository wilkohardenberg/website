<p>But there is one in particular that is just hinted to but that I found particularly compelling: the need for academics who use Wikipedia to improve it on the basis of the verification work they did after reading the entry.<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>I wonder did any of the work involved in separate verification of detail find its way back into Wikipedia?<&#47;p><br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>On the basis of this simple question I make an appeal to the academic world to get involved in making Wikipedia an increasingly better resource. There's no need for actual work, for rewriting entries, or for correcting them radically. Just adding third-party references would help to make it a more sound reference tool for future researchers. And this should not take more than a couple of minutes of our precious research&#47;teaching time.<&#47;p></p>
<p>PS. And if you have more than a couple of minutes to spare take part in this survey about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ht.ly&#47;3VPXI" title="Expert Barriers to Wikipedia" target="_blank">Expert Barriers to Wikipedia<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
<p>PPS. Recently Jim Clifford has written on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;activehistory.ca" target="_blank">activehistory.ca<&#47;a> another, more extensive blog entry about this issue: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;activehistory.ca&#47;2011&#47;06&#47;do-you-edit-wikipedia&#47; " target="_blank">Do you edit wikipedia? <&#47;a><&#47;p></p>
