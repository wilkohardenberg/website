<p>Herbert A. Millington<br />Chair - Search Committee<br />412A Clarkson Hall, Whitson University<br />College Hill, MA&nbsp; 34109
<p />Dear Professor Millington,
<p />Thank you for your letter of March 16.&nbsp; After careful consideration, I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your refusal to offer me an assistant professor position in your department.
<p /><a id="more"></a><a id="more-140"></a> This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually large number of rejection letters.&nbsp; With such a varied and promising field of candidates, it is impossible for me to accept all refusals.
<p /> Despite Whitson's outstanding qualifications and previous experience in rejecting applicants, I find that your rejection does not meet my needs at this time.&nbsp; Therefore, I will assume the position of assistant professor in your department this August.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing you then.
<p /> Best of luck in rejecting future applicants.
<p />Sincerely,<br />Chris L. Jensen
