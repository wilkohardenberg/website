<p style="margin: 1.2em 0px ! important;"><span class="gm_ gm_3a34d711-9786-c31d-aa04-6375ad6a4b72 gm-spell">A while ago Finn Arne J&oslash;rgensen (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/finnarne"><span class="gm_ gm_3a34d711-9786-c31d-aa04-6375ad6a4b72 gm-spell">@finnarne</span></a><span class="gm_ gm_3a34d711-9786-c31d-aa04-6375ad6a4b72 gm-spell">) came up with the idea to launch an online writing group, called Green Tomato</span><span class="gm_ gm_3a34d711-9786-c31d-aa04-6375ad6a4b72 gm-spell">, dedicated to scholars in the environmental humanities, inspired by </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"><span class="gm_ gm_3a34d711-9786-c31d-aa04-6375ad6a4b72 gm-spell">the Pomodoro technique</span></a><span class="gm_ gm_3a34d711-9786-c31d-aa04-6375ad6a4b72 gm-spell"> and existing Twitter based projects, such as </span><a href="http://www.phd2published.com/2013/10/09/announcing-acwrimo-2013/"><span class="gm_ gm_3a34d711-9786-c31d-aa04-6375ad6a4b72 gm-spell">#AcWriMo</span></a><span class="gm_ gm_3a34d711-9786-c31d-aa04-6375ad6a4b72 gm-spell">.</span> The idea was to keep up momentum in our writing and help us to make writing (again) a daily habit. Unfortunately, and in part ironically, the project itself, which was supposed to have its own dedicated blog and formal tracking system, never reached the needed momentum.<br />
I was reminded of all this yesterday, after more than a year, reading Jennifer Ahern-Dodson (<a href="https://twitter.com/jaherndodson">@jaherndodson</a>) excellent <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/5-lessons-about-daily-writing/58217">Prof.Hacker guest post</a><span class="gmw_"> on what she learnt from spending June writing every single day. <span class="gm_ gm_e2908c75-0526-7abb-df8d-316c38c91923 gm-spell">Since, with the beginning of the semester, my writing rhythm had slowed down to the point that it has become ridiculous to even talk about a rhythm, I decided that a writing group is just what I needed to, at least attempt to, meet all the writing deadlines that lie ahead of me.</span> Yes, the company of other people battling against looming word counts would help me &hellip; this time.</span><br />
It is not the first time I try; <a href="https://twitter.com/finnarne/status/397770600393211904">I gave a shot at #AcWriMo in 2013</a><span class="gmw_">, failing miserably. The worst thing is that I do not even know why; things just seemed to slip away. The only answer I could muster was that the reference group was too big to allow me to really feel involved. Furthermore, Pomodoro just doesn&rsquo;t seem to tick with me: the 25-minutes slots are just <span class="gm_ gm_920c322e-e218-eb81-b74a-43241edf6a63 gm-spell">to</span> short for me to write anything in any way significant. I simply spend too much time doing additional research and fact-checking while writing to make it worthwhile. My work methods might not be the best, but I do not think that to revolutionize them totally a couple of months before major deadlines would be the best approach. Reform is my motto!</span><br />
<span class="gmw_"> So, this time I'll keep things small and simple (additional features may come infuture, if it works and once I've updated this blog). The attempt will work as follows:</span></p></p>
<ul style="margin: 1.2em 0px; padding-left: 2em;">
<li style="margin: 0.5em 0px;">I&rsquo;ll try to write something every working day (and some weekends)</li>
<li style="margin: 0.5em 0px;">I&rsquo;ll post on Twitter how many words I&rsquo;ve been able to write</li>
<li style="margin: 0.5em 0px;">(I may or may not also track the time I spent at it)</li>
<li style="margin: 0.5em 0px;">I&rsquo;ll also specify whether I&rsquo;ve worked on my main project (a book manuscript), one of many major side projects, or a blog post</li>
<li style="margin: 0.5em 0px;">I&rsquo;ll not count anything written to prepare for teaching</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p style="margin: 1.2em 0px ! important;">If anyone else wants to join in and share with me his work progresses, they may join me under the hashtag #lazytomato. See you on Twitter!</p></p>
